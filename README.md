# recipe-hub
Recipe Hub is a web application that acts as a central repository for a user's cooking recipes.

Users can create new recipes and edit recipe information such as ingredient amounts or instructions.

This is mostly a playground for me to experiment with things I want to learn.

It features the following notable technologies:
* GraphQl
* Lambda, built via Serverless, deployed via Terraform
* Terraform
* React
* Typescript
* MongoDb
* Cypress
